I got the best gear money could buy, but that moron Jimmy got busted last month trying to smuggle in a few crates.<br/>

    That means you dont have a lot of ammo.<br/>
    <br/>
    Use your gear to your advantage, take long shots. Sneak, take your time.<br/>
    <br/>
    We do not have much spare medical equipment and none of you guys are trained medics, so BE CAREFUL.<br/>

    You can only repair your vehicle so much. If its busted, try to take one from a civilian or an empty one in the middle of a reporters town.
